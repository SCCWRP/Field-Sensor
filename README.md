Mobile application for pulling data from an arduino that is deployed in the field
Version: 1.0

A research project ran circa 2015 using an ardiuno with modular sensors attached (ph, salinity, etc...). The arduino could be deployed in the field and a mobile application using bluetooth could be used by a field worker to pull data from the arduino.

The mobile application was built using phonegap, backbone, and jquery mobile.
